*2048 Clone for Android*

This is a clone of <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048" target="_new">this 2048 game</a>

I made this game to get more comfortable with python, give myself a little maths related challenge and learning how to use Kivy for Android apps.

The game is played by swiping up, down, left or right. Whenever two tiles with the same number are pushed against each other they will add up and form a new tile with double the value. The goal of the game is to get a 2048 tile.
